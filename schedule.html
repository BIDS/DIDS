          <h1>What you can do with data science</h1>

	<p>Come learn about data science opportunities at Berkeley. Through a mix of
	presentations, panel discussions, and plenty of opportunities for networking,
	this event is being designed to help underrepresented undergraduates who are
	curious about data science, but might not yet know much about it, to learn
	more about what working in data science is like and opportunities that exist.
	By meeting data science practitioners and other students interested in data
	science, students may start to explore what path is right for them.  Sessions
	will be tailored undergraduate students considering opportunities in data
	science.</p>
